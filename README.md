# Open Talon

This repository contains the local infrastructure, Python services, and client apps for Open Talon. The canonical developer Python environment is the repository-root `.venv`.

## System Overview

Open Talon is a local-first collaboration system where users and agents are first-class participants.

At a high level:

- `services/gateway-edge` is the main entrypoint for clients and developer tools
- `apps/tui` provides a terminal UI that talks to the gateway
- `services/core-collab` manages shared collaboration concepts like workspaces, threads, participants, presence, and timelines across both humans and agents
- `services/agent-runtime` runs background agent work and publishes events back into the system
- `packages/contracts` defines shared models and contracts used across services
- `infrastructure` provides the local backing services that make the system work end to end

The typical flow is:

1. A client sends a request to `gateway-edge`.
2. The gateway reads and writes state in Postgres and Valkey, and publishes asynchronous work through Kafka.
3. Collaboration and agent services process that work and emit events for both user and agent participants.
4. The gateway streams results back to clients over HTTP, SSE, or WebSocket.
5. Langfuse captures observability data for prompts, traces, and evaluations.

## Architecture Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: Deployed via `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` directly supporting native `JSONB` properties alongside algorithmic embeddings operations for Vector Similarity Searching natively in the engine.
- **Kafka**: Deployed using `apache/kafka:3.8.0` utilizing `KRaft` mode (omitting Zookeeper), configured natively on mapped loops using high level partition assignments.
- **OpenBao**: Open-source fork of Hashicorp Vault running securely in Development mode tracking explicit Version 2 isolated secrets.
- **Valkey**: Drop-in compatible Redis equivalent caching infrastructure configured to handle immediate TTL caching.
- **Langfuse**: Self-hosted LLM observability stack for traces, prompts, and evaluations, deployed with Langfuse Web/Worker plus ClickHouse and MinIO.
- **Ollama AI**: Serves dynamic generative model orchestration natively mapped across standard REST.
    - Operates natively against Google's modern **Gemma 4** models, with the default test setup pulling the lightweight `gemma4:latest` model.

## Infrastructure

`./open-talon start` brings up the full local infrastructure stack and then starts the supported local gateway from `services/gateway-edge`.

Local services:

- `gateway-edge`: primary local API gateway for REST, SSE, WebSocket, collaboration, and admin APIs
- `postgres`: application database with `pgvector` enabled
- `kafka`: event bus for chat, collaboration, and agent-runtime traffic
- `openbao`: local secret store and token-validation backend
- `valkey`: session store, API-key cache, and short-lived gateway state
- `langfuse-web`: Langfuse UI and API surface
- `langfuse-worker`: Langfuse background processing
- `clickhouse`: Langfuse analytics/event store
- `minio`: Langfuse object storage for uploads and media
- `ollama`: local model serving endpoint

## Endpoints

Common local endpoints:

- `gateway-edge`: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## Credentials

Default local development credentials:

- `Postgres`
  username: `admin`
  password: `password`
  database: `app_db`
- `Langfuse Postgres database`
  database: `langfuse_db`
- `Valkey`
  password: `langfuse-dev-secret`
- `OpenBao`
  root token: `root`
- `Langfuse UI`
  URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  email: `admin@example.com`
  password: `admin123456`
- `MinIO`
  console: [http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091)
  username: `minio`
  password: `miniosecret`
- `ClickHouse`
  username: `langfuse`
  password: `langfuse`

These are local dev defaults from `infrastructure/.env.example`. Override them in your local env before starting the stack if you need different values.

## Persistence Design

Data persistence relies purely on strictly scoped host bind-mounts mapped recursively into `infrastructure/data/...`
Standard container operations or isolated unit tests can freely execute `docker compose down -v` across the infrastructure securely deleting the environment without affecting native AI parameters, databases blocks, or Kafka volumes hosted locally safely on the host physical drive.

> **Note**: Do not commit the `infrastructure/data/` payloads directly. It contains multi-gigabyte neural weight matrices specifically blocked via the repository `.gitignore` configuration.

## Python Environment

Use one virtualenv at the repository root for all local Python work:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-python.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

That root environment installs:

- shared contracts from `packages/contracts`
- the collaboration kernel from `services/core-collab`
- the agent runtime helpers from `services/agent-runtime`
- the gateway edge service from `services/gateway-edge`
- the TUI app from `apps/tui`
- repo-level test dependencies for gateway and infrastructure suites

`services/gateway-edge` is the only supported local gateway path for day-to-day development.

## Langfuse

The local compose stack now includes a self-hosted Langfuse deployment:

- `langfuse-web` on `http://localhost:3000`
- `langfuse-worker` on port `3030`
- `clickhouse` on ports `8123` and `9000`
- `minio` on ports `9090` and `9091`

This setup reuses the repository Postgres server and Valkey container, but Langfuse now uses its own Postgres database (`LANGFUSE_POSTGRES_DB`) so Prisma migrations do not collide with the application schema. Defaults live in `infrastructure/.env.example`.

Infra defaults are defined in `infrastructure/.env.example`, including:

- core ports for Postgres, Kafka, OpenBao, Valkey, Ollama, and Langfuse
- Langfuse database name and bootstrap credentials
- ClickHouse, MinIO, and Valkey credentials used by Langfuse
- the required Ollama model list for local startup

## Pytest Orchestration

Automations operate sequentially leveraging `pytest` through explicit Python networking wrappers. Calling testing natively maps background parallel assertions executing directly toward HTTP/TCP components actively checking if they are locally alive. You do not need to manually launch anything; `pytest` implicitly binds `./infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml` using Python `subprocess`.

```bash
# Enable the repository virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Default maintained unit suite
pytest -q

# Gateway tests only
pytest tests/gateway-edge -q

# Infrastructure integration tests
pytest -m integration test/infrastructure/test_infrastructure.py -v -s
```

## AI Model Initialization Note

First-time execution will wait for Ollama to fetch the configured default model from `infrastructure/.env`. The suite still allows long waits for first-run downloads, but it no longer assumes multiple heavyweight models by default.
